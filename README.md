# InteractionControl

MAJOR PATCH: original issues fixed. Control when you're allowed to 
interact with things. DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BY DEFAULT; use configs to 
change behavior.

- Allows grabbing objects while flying with the Jetpack.
- Allows switching item slots while flying with the Jetpack.
- Allows changing whether things can be triggered (not really sure what this does yet tbh; please try it out and let me know)
- No one can join your game if they don't have the mod installed.
